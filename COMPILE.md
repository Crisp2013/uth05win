### I got an error LNK1104: can not open 'lib/PMDWin.lib' while compiling
Create directory lib at root if you don't have, and download [PMDWin SDK](http://c60.la.coocan.jp/) (Japanese). extract the archive and copy the PMDWin.lib (located at PMDWin/) to lib directory.

### rt5sandbox.exe gives me an error saying GuruGuruSMF4.dll is missing.
